# JavaScript Challenges

## What we will practice:
    - Strings and Strings methods
    - Arrays and Arrays methods
    - Working with data and APIs
    - Classic interviews challenges like:
        - Reversing a string
        - finding anagrams
        - FizzBuzz
    - A skill we learn though practice
    - A efficient but limited way for a potential employer to gauge our ability to code
    - Not an amazing measure of our potential
    Tips for Success:
        - Write pseudo code (or look at someone else)
        - Use built-in methods, unless stated otherwise
        - Look things up
        - clg frequently
        - Practice solving problems aloud
        - Struck? Study solutions and try again
    Keep in mind:
        - Solved problem? We're doing great! (Optimization and edge cases are stretch goals)
        - Solution maybe will be different than others
        - Write 'pure' functions
            - A pure function is a function that:
                - Takes a value
                - Returns a value
            - A pure function is reusable function
        - Verbose and readable over short and clever
